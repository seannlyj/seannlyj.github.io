            <time datetime="2026-01-08">08 Jan, 2026</time>
            <p>
              It’s been quite a while since the last devlog, but a lot has happened behind the scenes. Over the past few months, I’ve significantly overhauled the game, starting with a full replacement of the original animation assets. 
              This change immediately elevated how combat feels, and it also gave me the opportunity to revisit and clean up large parts of the multiplayer netcode alongside it.
              <br>
              <br>
              With the new animations in place, I expanded the combat system with several new mechanics. Players can now dodge, perform a <em>perfect dodge</em> for precise timing, and block incoming attacks. 
              To improve readability during fast-paced exchanges, I also added hit indicators that signal when an opponent is about to attack, helping players make better moment-to-moment decisions. 
              On top of that, I spent time fine-tuning the overall combat flow so that attacks, movement, and defensive actions transition more smoothly into one another.
              <br>
              <br>
              Another major addition is a simple AI-controlled bot that players can practice against. While it’s not meant to be overly complex, it provides a consistent way to test combat mechanics, timings, and balance without needing a second player connected. 
              The video demo shows gameplay footage against a bot.
              <br>
              <br>
              At this stage, my focus has shifted slightly from pure systems work to figuring out the game’s overall <em>style</em> and <em>aesthetic</em>. I want to ensure the visuals and presentation properly support the feel of the combat before pushing further with content.
              Looking ahead, I’m also planning to explore options for online multiplayer services, as the game currently only supports multiplayer over local networks.
              <br>
              <br>
              There’s still plenty to refine, but the game now feels far more cohesive than it did a few months ago, and I’m excited to start shaping its identity as I move into the next phase of development.

            <p>
              I implemented multiplayer replication for combat and started testing the game across two devices on a local network this week. Initially, I ran into several connection issues—I only realized later 
              that my laptop couldn't even ping my PC through the command line (lol). Once I fixed the network issue, the multiplayer session worked as expected.
              <br>
              <br>
              During testing, I made an interesting observation: even though my laptop isn't designed for gaming and struggled with low framerate and peformance, these limitations also affected how 
              the client's character appeared on other players' screens. Essentially the performance of one device impacted the representation of that player for everyone else, highlighting an important 
              consideration for multiplayer optimization.
              <br>
              <br>
              Overall, this testing session helped me uncover both technical hurdles and subtle performance challenges that I'll need to address as I continue refining the multiplayer experience.

            <p>
              This week, I focused on implementing the foundations of multiplayer replication in Unreal Engine. 
              I integrated replication with core systems like player movement and the camera lock-on feature, making sure that actions such as locking onto a target are accurately reflected across all connected clients.
              <br>
              <br>
              Getting replication to play nicely with the lock-on system was a particular challenge, since each client needs to maintain its own local control while still keeping the server authoritative. 
              I had to carefully manage when and how target data was sent to the server to avoid desyncs, while ensuring that the player’s camera remained responsive.

            <time datetime="2025-09-04">04 Sep, 2025</time>
            <p>
              This week, I worked on adding a camera lock-on system and refraction trails for player attacks. 
              The lock-on system lets players fix their view on a chosen enemy, making combat encounters easier to follow while 
              still keeping the target clearly visible. 
              <br>
              <br>
              I also experimented with Unreal Engine’s Niagara System to build refraction trails that follow attacks. 
              Getting used to Niagara was challenging at first, but I eventually managed to create striking visual effects that make combat feel more impactful.

            <time datetime="2025-08-26">26 Aug, 2025</time>
            <p>
              One of the biggest lessons I carried over from my internship at HABBY is that great feedback is what makes or breaks a game’s feel. 
              With that in mind, I focused on designing hit feedback using three core elements: hitstops, hitflashes, and—most importantly—camera shake. 
              Together, these details make every hit feel weighty, rewarding, and satisfying for the player.

            <p>
              This week, I expanded on the combat system by implementing both light and heavy attacks, along with the ability to fluidly chain them together. 
              These changes made combat more dynamic and gave players more agency over their playstyle, resulting in a faster, more engaging flow of action.

            <time datetime="2025-08-05">5 Aug, 2025</time>
            <p>
              After setting up character locomotion, I began experimenting with a prototype combo system for melee combat. 
              I drew inspiration from combat-heavy titles like For Honor, Absolver, and Sifu. 
              My initial prototype now allows players to execute a sequence of attacks in quick succession—laying the foundation for a deeper combo-based combat system.

            <p>
              Following my internship at HABBY, I wanted to branch out from Unity and learn Unreal Engine. 
              I started with the basics of locomotion and character movement. 
              Coming from a Unity background, the transition to Unreal’s Blueprint system felt daunting at first, 
              but with the help of tutorials, I quickly got comfortable and began building my first mechanics.

                <p>This game began as a two-week experimental project, created as a short break from a Unreal Engine project (Project Pugilist) I was working on.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Using Unity as a familiar development environment, I focused on translating what I had learned from Unreal into the design of a fast-paced action combat system. A key highlight of the project is the Mudra mechanic, where players execute specific sequences to cast spells, adding an additional layer of depth beyond standard combat.</p>
                <br>
                <p>As development progressed, I found the core concept increasingly compelling, motivating me to continue evolving the project beyond a prototype into a fully playable game. The spell system was intentionally designed to promote synergy and planning, encouraging players to think strategically about how different mudras and abilities interact.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Through this project, I sharpened my skills in rapid prototyping, combat design, and experimenting with mechanics that reward player mastery.</p>"

                <p>During my internship at HABBY, I worked on a mobile arcade game built around bottle flipping.</p>

                  This involved experimenting with physics adjustments, implementing responsive touch controls, and iterating on visual/audio feedback to
                  amplify the satisfaction of each successful flip.
